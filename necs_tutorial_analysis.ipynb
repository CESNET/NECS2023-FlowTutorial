    "# Time Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Network traffic forecasting provides critical information for network management, resource allocation, and attack detection. We will forecast by using the basic ARIMA model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ARIMA model \n",
    " \n",
    "ARIMA is an extension of the ARMA model (Autoregressive Moving average), which also allows use on non-stationary time series. We write as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ARIMA(p,d,q)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$ is the order of the AR component and expresses how many time intervals back this component of the model \"looks\", $d$ is the order of the integration component and means the number of consecutive times the difference is applied (removal of trend, $d = 1$, or/and seasonality, $d = 2$), and $q$ is the order of the MA component and expresses from how many time intervals in the past the errors in the model are applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the seasonality of time series, the basic model can be supplemented with an ARIMA model of the seasonal component, the parameters of which are marked with capital letters and given in additional brackets with $M$ that represents periodicity, in total: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, M)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $(P, D, Q, M)$ order refers to the seasonal component of the model for the Auto Regressive parameters, differences, Moving Average parameters, and periodicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $D$ indicates the integration order of the seasonal process (the number of transformations needed to make stationary the time series)\n",
    "- $P$ indicates the Auto Regressive order for the seasonal component\n",
    "- $Q$ indicated the Moving Average order for the seasonal component\n",
    "- $M$ indicates the periodicity, i.e., the number of periods in season, such as 12 for monthly data.\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA models are estimated using the so-called Box–Jenkins method, proposed by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins. It has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model order identification and selection. This part of the analysis is to find out which values ​​of the orders $p$, $d$, $q$ or $P$, $D$, $Q$ are to be set. Here, the analysis of autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations of the examined time series is used.\n",
    "2. Estimation of regression coefficients, usually by the method of maximum likelihood\n",
    "3. Testing the model, especially the stationarity of its residuals."
